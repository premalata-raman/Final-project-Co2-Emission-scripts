# Final Project: CO2 Emission Data Cleaning and Merging

This repository contains scripts and datasets related to the cleaning and merging of CO2 emission data. The primary goal of this project is to preprocess raw CO2 emission datasets to create a refined and consolidated dataset suitable for further analysis.

## Repository Structure

- **after_clean_datasets/**: Contains datasets that have been cleaned and are ready for analysis.
- **before_clean_datasets/**: Contains the original raw datasets prior to cleaning.
- **merged_datasets/**: Contains datasets that have been merged after the cleaning process.
- **python_script/**: Contains Python scripts used for data cleaning and merging operations.

## Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process involves several key steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and appropriately managing missing or null values in the datasets.
2. **Standardizing Formats**: Ensuring consistency in data formats, such as date representations and numerical values.
3. **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
4. **Data Transformation**: Applying necessary transformations to align data from different sources for seamless merging.

## Merging Process

After cleaning, the datasets are merged based on common identifiers to create a comprehensive dataset that combines information from multiple sources. This consolidated dataset facilitates more extensive analysis of CO2 emissions.

## Usage

To replicate the data cleaning and merging process:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/premalata-raman/Final-project-Co2-Emission-scripts.git
   cd Final-project-Co2-Emission-scripts
